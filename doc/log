The stanford-prp-parser need the delimiter to be '\r\n' (corenlp.py line 151), so I change spaCynlp to produce prp-file whose delimit is '\r\n'. But the preprocessing.py (line 260) need the delimiter of dependency-file should be '\n'.
The current solution is make the prp and dep file have different delimiter.

I have failed to run camr outside the folder. After I revise corenlp to change to indirect path to direct path. There existed some unknown error.
I have solved the problem. We all know that we use sys.path.apppend('..') to import upper library while directly run the python script. But if we want to run the python script outside it, we need to use sys.path.append('.')

The results are all messed. There are several improvments.
* use the other model
* change the structure feature because the feature is somewhat too strong.
