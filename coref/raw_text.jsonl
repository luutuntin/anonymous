New leadership could prove to be the key to revitalizing the peace process in the Middle East, as both Israel and the United States had refused to work with Arafat. The ''Haaretz had initially reported that former prime minister Mahmoud Abbas was selected by the Fatah central committee as their candidate for president, but Abbas has denied this, saying, \"the matter is still being discussed.\n\" There have also been conflicting reports on whether or not jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti will run. Barghouti is currently serving five life sentences in Israel for attacks against Israelis.\nNonetheless, he remains a popular figure among Palestinians for his role in the Palestinian uprising, and could potentially win the election if he decided to run. A win by Barghouti could put Israel in an awkward spot; however an Israeli official said this week that he would not be freed, and a landslide win by Barghouti would signify to them that the Palestinians were not yet ready for peace."}

Uranium is a chemical element which can be used in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.  \nThe process of conversion modifies the uranium oxydes into uranium hexafluoride.  \nThe purpose of such a conversion process is usually an intermediate step in the production of nuclear fuel.\nUranium hexafluoride cannot itself be used in a nuclear weapon, but can be enriched into weapons-grade uranium, or it can be converted into plutonium in a nuclear reactor.\nIran has claimed to be using its nuclear program for only peaceful nuclear energy, rather than for nuclear weapons, but there are concerns in the European Union and the USA as to whether they are being truthful."}

Paul Volcker, a former American official investigating the diverted funds scandal, has taken some heat from advocates demanding that he haul United Nations personnel before the US Congress.\nHis reason for not subjecting them to this degree of open scrutiny is that it would have the perverse effect of pushing them into refusing to cooperate with the investigation at all.\nHe plans to release documentary evidence early next year, when his investigation is complete."}
