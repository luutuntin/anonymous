1. Some features we can use
2. About how to extract the structure information, we can use the adjacent matrix or adjacent list. And encode the edge with one-hot. We can conclude some knowledge subgraph structure (which include the structure and the edge label)
For example:
(p / person ï¼šname (n / name :op1 xx :op2 xx))


(p / person
	:arg-of (h / have-org-role-91
		:ARG1 ()
		:ARG2 ()))


(i / include
	:op1 ()
	:op2 ()
	...
	)


(p / person :)


(a1 / f1 :l1 () :l2() :l3())
(a1 / f1
	:l1 (
		:l2())
	:l3())
